# jenkins-by-me
Tuts on jenkins by me
1) to install jenkins, first java jdk should be there
2) after installing jdk we can install jenkins
3) we can access jenkins using vmIP:8080  8080 port bcoz jenkins runs on this port
4) installed one plugin named Docker pipeline it will use docker container as jenkins worker nodes






PS: we can restart jenkins by adding /restart at the end of url
